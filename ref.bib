abstract = "A new method has been developed for the optimization of pressurized water reactor loading patterns. The optimization algorithm is built of the enhanced simulated annealing cooling schedule and adaptive trial loading pattern generator. Trial loading patterns are evaluated using one-and-a-half dimensonal two energy group diffusion code, which provides a good trade off between the speed and accuracy in scoping analysis. A simplified loading pattern optimization test problem with predefined global optimum of the given objective function is designed in order to analyze the efficiency of different optimization strategies. The results obtained using different cooling schedules and trial loading pattern generator modes illustrate their importance in the optimization algorithm and identify efficient strategies for simulated annealing based loading pattern optimization."
